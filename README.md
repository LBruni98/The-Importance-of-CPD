# The Importance of CPD
#### What is CPD
CPD stands for Continuing Professional Development. This is the process of documenting the skills, knowledge and experiance that you gain as you work, by recording what you experience or learn and then apply towards a folder or portfolio such as a professional. The process of CPD helps with development on an ongoing basis, to improve upon your skills and develop further rather than just following a document with tasks or a tick-box document.

#### The Importance of CPD to Learning
What CPD does is give you ongoing knowledge that you can look back on and apply continuously within your professional career, instead of just completing each task and sitting back mostly. It helps you become more competent in your chosen profession, making sure that you are on pace with your colleauges and to stay on top of ever changing standards. This helps because you can make a meaningful contributuion to the workplace, clients will be more than likely to consider you based on your practices and helps you become interested and stay interesting.
