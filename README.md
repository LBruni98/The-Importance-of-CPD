Right, let's set the scene.

You've finished your degree, completed the experience in order to graduate and now on your way to your dream job. Congratulations, now it is time to have that well deserved break, right? Well, you have earned it, but I wouldn't take too much of a breather, otherwise your skills will be lacking immensely compared to others in the same field of work. Now, you're a bit worried but don't be, because that's what Continued Professional Development is there for; helping you out to be competent within your profession.

### What is Continued Professional Development?

Continued Professional Development, or CPD for short, is the process of documenting the skills, knowledge and experience that you gain as you work, gained both formally or informally and outside of any training. What it is mainly is a record of what you learn or your skills that you pick up and apply along the way, documented within your portfolio or physical folder of work. Basically, showcasing your development as a proper professional.

### What's so Special About it?

CPD is a more broader process and not just some tick-box, criteria fulfilling form or assessment. What CPD does is give you ongoing knowledge that you can look back on and apply continuously within your professional career, instead of just completing each task and sitting back mostly. It helps you become more competent in your chosen profession, making sure that you are on pace with your colleagues and to stay on top of ever changing standards.

There are massive benefits towards CPD, some factors that hopefully make you consider resorting to it to help you stay ahead:

* It provides an overview of your professional development to date
* It reminds you of your achievements and how far you've progressed
* CPD directs your career and helps you keep your eye on your goals
* It uncovers gaps in your skills and capabilities
* It opens up further development needs
* CPD provides examples and scenarios for a CV or interview
* It demonstrates your professional standing to clients and employers
* and it helps you with your career development or a possible career change.

Not only would you, the individual, benefit and have to use CPD, organizations use it to help with recognition and increased brand perception, providing a healthy learning culture for your organisation and in turn, leading to a more fulfilled workforce and retaining valuable staff.

In relation towards my own experience, I am currently undergoing learning in a new college course, the HND Video Game Design and Production. Unlike normal courses in HND, this one basically focuses on CPD within learning, helping students to develop their professionalism with developing portfolios showcasing their work and focusing on projects, tasks and occasionally, actual clients rather than deadlines and assignments.
